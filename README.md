Sinusoidesque v1.0
==================

Mr. Barnes personally believes the definitions of sine and cosine were probably arbitrary but serendipitous inventions. He thinks some bored Greek kid was just cooking up strange functions for fun one day around 250 BC, and sine and cosine happened to be two of them. It just so happened they turned out to be beautiful and so important as to be utterly inescapable in math and physics.

What if, instead of looking at the coordinates of intersections on the unit circle, we looked at intersections on the unit square? Or the shape of a sunflower?

This program achieves that goal. It allows one to find the corresponding sine and cosine functions for a circle, polygon, hand-drawn figure, or imported image (where the image edge is determined by the color difference from the center).

The entire program is written in Java and encapsulated in the executable file "Sinusoidesque.jar" with no external dependencies. Several examples, with both the input figure and the resulting "trigonometric" functions, are included in the "Examples" folder.

This project, created in the fall of 2014 by Daniel Teal in LASA High School's class "Logic, Reasoning, and Proof" by Charlie Barnes, is available under the CC0 1.0 Universal license.
